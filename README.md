# Object-Detection-using-YOLOv3-Algorithm
Performs Object Detection using YOLOv3 Algorithm on MS-COCO Dataset images using transfer learning on pre-trained weights. Due to GitHub file size constraints, project files have not been uploaded to this repository. Though the implementation can be referred to this [link](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/12/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv/) which served as the primary reference while developing this project.
